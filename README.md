## Introduction

- A novice attempt in trying apply basic React knowledge to recreate the submenus functionality of Strapi using Context API for state management and CSS to recreate the hovering effect to display content when hovering

- Strapi Submenus: https://react-vite-strapi-submenus.netlify.app/

## Steps

- npm install
- npm run dev

#### 3D Effect

These lines of CSS are used to apply a 3D transformation to an element on a webpage. Here's what each line does:

transform: rotateX(-90deg) translateX(-50%);
The transform property applies a transformation to an element. In this case, it applies two transformations: rotateX(-90deg) and translateX(-50%).

rotateX(-90deg) rotates the element around the X-axis by -90 degrees, which means it will appear to be flipped upside down.
translateX(-50%) moves the element horizontally by -50% of its own width, effectively shifting it to the left.
Together, these transformations make the element appear to be rotated and tilted, as if it's viewed from above and at an angle.

transform-origin: top;
The transform-origin property specifies the point around which the element should be rotated and transformed. In this case, it's set to top, which means the transformation should be applied around the top edge of the element.

perspective: 1000px;
The perspective property defines the distance between the viewer and the element, and affects the appearance of 3D transformations. In this case, it's set to 1000px, which means the element will appear to be tilted and rotated as if it's viewed from a distance of 1000 pixels.

Overall, these lines of CSS are used to create a 3D effect for an element, making it appear to be tilted and rotated in a particular way.

#### Mouse Events

onMouseEnter: This event is triggered when the mouse cursor enters the target element. It can be used to trigger an action when the user hovers over an element.

onMouseOver: This event is triggered when the mouse cursor is moved over the target element or any of its child elements. It can be used to track the mouse movement and trigger actions accordingly.

onMouseLeave: This event is triggered when the mouse cursor leaves the target element. It can be used to trigger an action when the user stops hovering over an element.
